            Hi, I'm Andr√© Moreira Lopes. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science. Web development unexpectedly became a passion in my life and has transformed into a hobby. I've taken the initiative to learn more and work on web development projects out of sheer curiosity and a desire to expand my skill set.

        <h2>Academic Background</h2>
        <p>
            My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, which has provided me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and analytical skills. This background has proven to be advantageous in my web development journey, as I was already familiar with programming languages.
